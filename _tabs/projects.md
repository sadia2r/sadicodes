# ⚙️ Flagship Projects  

These projects showcase my ability to design **AI/NLP systems, retrieval pipelines and intelligent web apps**. Each is rooted in real-world problems, many with legal applications, but the technical approaches are generalisable across industries.

### ⚖️ Document AI Summariser & Risk Detector (Flagship)  

This project demonstrates large-scale text ingestion, NLP pipelines, and AI-powered summarisation. It processes long-form documents (e.g. contracts, asylum letters, reports) into **concise summaries, risk highlights and plain-language explanations**.  

**Features:**  
- Document upload (PDF/DOCX/TXT).  
- AI-generated summaries and risk detection.  
- Flags missing clauses and inconsistencies.  
- Generates plain-English explanations for non-experts.  

**Tech Stack:** Python, LangChain, OpenAI API, Flask UI

### 📚 Semantic Search & Case Explorer  

Built as a **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline**, this tool enables intelligent search across case law databases (or any large text corpus). Users can input a case citation or query and receive **summaries, key holdings and related precedents**.  

**Features:**  
- Case citation input → automated retrieval.  
- AI summaries with structured breakdown (e.g. ratio vs obiter).  
- Embedding-based search for similar/related cases.  
- Dashboard UI for efficient browsing.  

**Tech Stack:** Python, RAG pipeline (embeddings + scraping), Vector Database, Dashboard UI

### 📝 AI Intake & Classification Assistant  

This project focuses on **document classification, entity extraction and urgency scoring**.  
Designed for legal aid triage but adaptable to any workflow that requires fast **document analysis and task prioritisation**.  

**Features:**  
- Upload letters or evidence → structured extraction pipeline.  
- Entity recognition and issue detection.  
- AI-driven urgency and priority scoring.  
- Exports structured reports (PDF/email) for downstream use.  

**Tech Stack:** Python, FastAPI, OpenAI API, Workflow-driven UI

## 🚀 What These Projects Show  

- **AI/NLP Engineering** → document processing, embeddings, summarisation, classification.  
- **Full-Stack Delivery** → from backend pipelines (FastAPI, LangChain) to frontend dashboards. 
- **Applied Innovation** → examples come from legal contexts, but methods apply to finance, healthcare, education and beyond.
