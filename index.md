Hi, I’m Sadia — I build lightweight AI and LegalTech tools with a focus on clarity, function and real-world impact.  
I'm interested in how automation and thoughtful design can improve the way people interact with legal processes.

The projects on this page highlight some of the smaller tools I’ve built around the things I enjoy: reading, learning and photography. 
For the more technical LegalTech builds, the Projects section gives a clearer picture of how I think and what I build.

## Personal Projects

### 📚 AI-Powered Reading & Media Tracker  
A React/Next.js app to log books and shows, fetching cover data from APIs (Goodreads, OMDb).  
I built this because I read widely and wanted a tool that combines **organisation with data visualisation**.  

**Tech:** React, Next.js, Goodreads API, OMDb API

An AI-powered learning companion that generates flashcards and quizzes from uploaded notes.
